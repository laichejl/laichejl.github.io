## Codepen Inteface Analysis

For my Writing & Digital Media class, we were tasked with picking a website and doing a comprehensive analysis of the design, functionality and user experience of the site. I chose CodePen.io, a site made for interactively testing snippets of HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. 

In this analysis, I intially examined the main interface of the site, which is the testing suite. I additionally analyzed the site's social network functionality, as well as their member system and basic site design. Finally, I tested myself with site challeneges and reported findings on the overall UX of the site. My final findings commented on whether or not I thought CodePen stood up compared to other sites that perform similar functions.
