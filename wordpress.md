## Tall Oaks Montessori

For my Developing Online Content class, we were tasked with recreating a website for a real-world client of our choice. Tall Oaks Montessori was a local school in Blacksburg, VA that was in need of a new website; their current website was antiquated and ran off Google Sites. Myself and a group of 3 others completely redesigned their site using the Wordpress CMS. Additionally, we created new graphics, new copy, and a new UX. 

The project began by drafting a Statement of Work which was sent and examined by the client. We then drafted wireframes, which were sent to the client to overview and comment on. We met with the client multiple times over the development of the website to ensure progress met their standards. Throughout site development, we used a Wordpress theme that used the Bootstrap framework, as well as custom CSS by us. We took professional pictures, created graphics via Photoshop and came up with copy for the site. After finishing the site, we performed user testing on multiple user groups and addressed UX issues accordingly. 

Our final product was a fully functional, responsive Wordpress site that could be easily used and customized by our client.
