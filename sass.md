## Sass Blog Article

During my Developing Online Content Class, we were asked to write a blog post during the semester on a particular web development topic. I chose to write about the Sass CSS preprocessor and its various uses and implementations. The target audience of this particular blog post was aimed at beginning web development students, so I chose to introduce the idea of learning Sass from a beginner's perspective.

The content of my blog post begins by describing how to install and compile Sass, and then moves on to simple Sass features such as nesting, variables, mixins and functions. Throughout the article, I explain that beginning web development students should be learning Sass as they learn basic CSS. The main takeaway from the article is that CSS should lay the foundations while Sass provides the more semantic syntax.
