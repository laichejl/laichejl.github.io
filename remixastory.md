## Game of Thrones Web Remix

In my Writing & Digital Media class, we were tasked with taking a story from literature or popular culture and "remixing" it using modern creative tools. I chose to remix the iconic "Red Wedding" scene from the HBO series Game of Thrones. I chose to model my remix in the form of a webpage that mocks a chatroom. This project involved the use of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Photoshop. 

The gist of this project was to create a chatroom where the users are characters of the scene. They hold an internet wedding, but users begin getting booted from the chatroom, rather than getting murdered, like in the actual scene. The goal was to turn the rather morbid scene into an adaptation that is appropriate for all ages. 

To accomplish this, I created the webpage using HTML & CSS and created functionality with chat buttons using jQuery. Finally, I used Photoshop to create a .gif animated chat interface, giving the chat the appearance of happening in real-time.
