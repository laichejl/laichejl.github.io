## KVB Responsive

During my summer internship at Rocket Pop Media, one of my first tasks was taking the current website of Keep Virginia Beautiful (keepvabeautiful.org) and making it responsive, meaning the layout and content of the site would adapt to any screen size. 

These changes were made primarily with CSS, using the Sass preprocessor to speed up the coding process. CSS edits were made according to client specifications. Additionally, the edits made use of the jQuery JavaScript library for some mobile functionality, such as the mobile dropdown menu. The final product is a fully responsive, functioning site running on the Wordpress CMS.
