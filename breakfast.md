## Breakfast

This project involved using XML in the Darwin Informational Typing Architecture (DITA) data model for my Creating User Documentation class. For this particular project, we published two separate DITA outputs using the same topics. The goal of the project was to create a list of recipes in the DITA model to create breakfast; however, one was a PDF (for a mother) and the other was a WebHelp (for a friend). Additionally, the friend was stipulated to be a vegetarian, so recipes needed to change slightly for the two outputs.

To create the separate outputs, we set values on certain XML elements and excluded/included elements with those values when transforming topics into outputs. The result of this was a PDF optimized for one user, and a WebHelp module for another user. Both final outputs were further customized for design; the PDF was customized using LibreOffice, while the WebHelp with customized with CSS changes.
