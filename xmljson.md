## XML vs JSON - Data Interchange

During my Creating User Documentation class, we were asked to write a research article on a technical writing topic. I chose to do a user-research study, in which I presented 10 different users with a topic marked up in JSON and XML individually, and asked for their opinions on the syntax. After gathering results, I compiled an article detailing my findings. I chose to study XML and JSON because they are two compatible formats for data interchange.

My article began with research on both XMl and JSON's origins, as well as their various implementations. I then moved on to their respective syntax; I found two topics online that were the same in content, but written in different languages. I tested 10 different users of varying backgrounds, but placed emphasis on users with backgrounds in programming, since they had some exposure to various syntaxes. However, I also chose to test those with no backgrounds at all as controls. 

My final findings found that JSON was much easier to read, but writing was inconclusive. These findings conclude that JSON may be used for reading topics in DITA to those who are unfamiliar with XML syntax; however, for writing topics in user documentation, XML was still a preferred markup.
