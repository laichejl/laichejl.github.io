## Shred the Gnar Wordpress Theme

During my internship at Rocket Pop Media, one of my biggest projects was to develop a custom Wordpress theme from scratch for Shred the Gnar wakeboard school in North Carolina. For this project, I completely redesigned the site's interface, as well as reimagining the user experience. The site is also fully responsive and uses the Sass preprocessor. The total site is coded heavily in PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery. 

I began the process by generating a UX map of various pages, then moved on to using Photoshop to create comps of site pages. Finally, I began a mobile-first development process using the responsive.gs grid system for responsive development. I began structuring the site using Wordpress PHP, structuring pages for information, blog posts, and contact. Finally, the site was optimized with extra functionality using the jQuery library.

My final product was easily navigable site for those who are interested in taking wakeboard lessons. Additionally, it utilized the Wordpress CMS so the client can easily edit and modify her site as she pleases.
