            <h1>So, seriously…who is Jay Laiche?</h1>

<h2>I’m glad you asked.</h2>

<p>Throughout my undergraduate years, I was never sure what field exactly I wanted to get into. I always truly loved writing, yet was very interested in technology, specifically on the web. A entry level web-design course spurred my interest in the field of web development, but writing was still a huge part of my repertoire- how could I combine these interests into something meaningful? For so long I saw them as inseparable- I wrote off my English degree as something useless, and wanted to forget that I was ever a Professional Writing major, in hopes of becoming a pure developer. It wasn’t until recently that I came to the realization of how useful my degree was, as it gave me a firm foundation in design, user experience and interaction design that will lead me down a path of success in the future.</p>

<p>As a pure developer, classwork in Developing Online Content turned me into a basic developer, with added skills from online tutorials and an internship furthering my skills. These experiences gave me a firm foundation in modern web development, and I continue to learn new things as I go. When I began work in the Professional Writing option at Virginia Tech, I was introduced to topics I had never thought about, such as Interaction Design, User Experience, and more. These topics introduced to me to the philosophy behind the code I was writing, looking at the bigger picture of why things were produced the way they were. It was this balance of technical skills and theory that made me a well-rounded designer &amp; developer. From these experiences, I have learned many skills such as front-end development, graphic design, prototyping, user testing and more. I bring a strong amount of knowledge in all of these fields, making me a well-rounded and useful candidate in the job field. </p>

<p>Thanks to a holistic academic experience at Virginia Tech, I have become a conscious developer and designer who intends on changing the way people use and interact with technology. Upon graduation, I intend to focus on development while incorporating my knowledge of user experience and design to create beautiful web-based technologies. </p>
