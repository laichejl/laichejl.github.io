# So, seriously...who is Jay Laiche?

## I'm glad you asked.

I'm currently a student at Virginia Tech, about to graduate with a degree in Professional Writing and a minor in Communications. I've emphasized my studies around web development, graphic design and user experience. During my undergraduate career, I worked for FratMusic.com (need link) (a music service that pioneered web-native playlists), WhiteRaverRafting.com(an eletronic music blog that is internationally renowned in the scene), IDD Inc. (a web development firm in Blacksburg, VA), and Rocket Pop Media (a web development firm in Richmond, VA). Additionally, I've freelanced as a web developer and copywriter with my cousin (a graphic designer) for a couple years now. 

When I'm not staring into the abyss of a computer screen, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, running, drinking craft beers, and finding new music that you've probably never heard of. Some cool things I've done: interviewed Pretty Lights, hiked Arches & Canyonlands National Park in Utah, scuba dove in Cozumel, Mexico, and gone to multiple music festivals throughout the US. I'm a vegetarian and environmentalist as well.
