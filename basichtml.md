## Basic HTML & CSS Site

This site was created in my Developing Online Content class at Virginia Tech. The site was a basic introduction to skills such as HTML, CSS, FTP, and DNS. It was also an introduction to user experience and design, specifically for the web. 

The site features a basic splash page with a background image of myself, and a black bar covering my eyes. It also includes a link to a resume as well.
