## Bootstrap

This project was an introduction to the Bootstrap front-end framework, as well an introduction to responsive and mobile-first web development for my Developing Online Content class. Our goal for this project was to take the current site of a local Blacksburg business and reimagine the site using a reponsive framework. 

The development of this site involved prototyping with basic bootstrap components, further customization with Bootswatch CSS and final tweaks with custom CSS. I also incorporated some basic PHP to include header and footer files across multiple pages. 

This site was also an introducting to UI prototyping. Before development of the site, I used Balsamiq to prototype multiple pages of the site. This process taught me not only the tools of prototyping, but also reinforced user experience tropes and best practices.
